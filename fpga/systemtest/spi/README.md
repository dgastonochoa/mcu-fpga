This is a stand-alone visual SPI test. Once programmed in the FPGA,
it will send/receive data between a master and slave and show the
results via the FPGA's LEDs. Some switches can be used to modify
the data that master and slave send respectively, and to display
either the data read by the master or the slave respectively.

See the `Makefile` to check how to config. the Vivado project.
