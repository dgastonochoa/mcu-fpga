# Summary

This directory contains all the FPGA-related files in the project.

# Applications

The `app` folder contains the available applications.

It only contains a led blink application for now.

:warning: The RISC-V MCU is not in `app` because the only application that exists for it is the
system tests developed for it. See `systemtest` directory.

# Test

There are 2 types of tests:
 - Small, automatic test benches that resemble what could be called unit-tests. See `test` directory.
 - More complex system tests designed to be run on a physical FPGA. See `systemtest` directory.

All the automatic test benches are written in SystemVerilog and are meant to be run with
IcarusVerilog v11.0

# SIMPLERISCV

'simpleriscv' is the name given to the RISC-V SoC implemented in this project to be synthetized on
an FPGA.

Its memory map is as following:

| Address                       | Device/Memory |
| 0x00000000..0x7ffffffc        | RAM memory    |
| 0x80000000..0x8000003c        | SPI master    |
| 0x80000040..0x8000007c        | LED           |
| 0x80000080..0x800000bc        | Input pin     |

These peripherals are very simple; they don't admit configuration.

# Vivado

FPGA name in Vivado: xc7a35tcpg236-1

# GTKWave

This section contains tips to use GTKWave to show the files generated by iverilog.

GTKWave bigger waves
--------------------
gtkwave -A --rcvar 'fontname_signals Monospace 15' --rcvar 'fontname_waves Monospace 13'

Those variables can be written in `~/.gtkwaverc` as:

```
fontname_signals Monospace 15
fontname_waves Monospace 13
```
